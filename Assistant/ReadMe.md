# Use the contents of this folder 
## Main.py is the functional backend file, that can be run solo to execute pyhton assistant features
## flask_server.py is the connecting point between main.py and frontend
## Frontend files are: main.css, main.html, main.js
## rest of the files were created while executing the program( eg. package.json created after I tried using npm init(make an app in electron.js) )
